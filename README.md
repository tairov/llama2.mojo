## why this port?

This repository serves as a port that provides a Mojo-based implementation of `llama2.c`.

With the release of [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-its-finally-here), I was inspired to take my Python port
of [llama2.py](https://github.com/tairov/llama2.py) and transition it to Mojo. The result? A version that leverages
Mojo's SIMD & vectorization primitives, boosting the Python performance by nearly 250x. Impressively, the Mojo version
now outperforms the original `llama2.c` compiled in `runfast` mode out of the box by 15-20%.
This showcases the potential of hardware-level optimizations through Mojo's advanced features.
I think this also can help us to see how far can we go with the original `llama2.c` hardware optimizations.

## performance

Since there were some debates was this comparison legit or not I did some research and found that in `runfast`
mode `llama2.c`
includes multiple optimizations like aggressive vectorization, which makes comparison fair with Mojo SIMD vectorization.

Further researches of both solutions in parallelized mode compilation showed that `llama2.c` is faster by ~20%
I'm still investigating in this direction since not all the possible optimizations were applied to the Mojo version so
far.

## prerequisites

Make sure you have installed
and [configured mojo on your environment](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/index.html)

Or you can use [mojo playground](https://playground.modular.com/) to run this model.

Llama is an animal was walking down the street. She stopped and looked up with a big smile on her face. She had a puppy in her arms. She was so excited to have a new friend.
The puppy ran up to her and said, "Hi! I'm here to be your friend!"
Mandy smiled and said, "Hi! I'm Mandy. Can I play with you?"
The puppy barked and wagged his tail. Mandy was so happy! She gave the puppy a big hug and they played with the puppy all afternoon.
When it was time to go home, Mandy said, "I have to go now. Goodbye!"
The puppy barked and said, "Goodbye Mandy! See you tomorrow!"
Mandy waved goodbye and then she went back home. She was so happy to have a new friend.

## play with Tinyllama-1.1B-Chat-v0.2

The [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) is a 1.1B Llama model trained on 3 trillion tokens. This
compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint.
This is also the reason why we select it as the first model to support.

First, navigate to the folder when you keep your projects and clone this repository to this folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tairov/llama2.mojo.git
```

Then, open the repository folder:

```bash
cd llama2.mojo
```

Now, let's download the model and the tokenizer

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/kirp/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.2-bin/resolve/main/tok_tl-chat.bin
wget https://huggingface.co/kirp/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.2-bin/resolve/main/tl-chat.bin
```

Then, just run the Mojo

```bash
mojo llama2.mojo tl-chat.bin \
    -z tok_tl-chat.bin \
    -n 256 -t 0 -s 100 -i "<|im_start|>user\nGive me a python function to generate Fibonacci sequence<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
```

**example output**

```
num hardware threads:  6
SIMD vector width:  16
checkpoint size:  4400767004 [ 4196 MB ]
n layers:  22
vocab size:  32003
<|im_start|>user
Give me a python function to generate Fibonacci sequence<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Sure, here's a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence:

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

This function takes an integer n as a parameter and returns the next Fibonacci number. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0 and working up. The function returns the value it found at the current level of the recursion, which can be either 0 or a Fibonacci number.
